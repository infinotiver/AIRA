## Artificially Intelligent Responsible (_also_ Robotic) Assistant

This Python project implements a personal assistant using the `customtkinter` library for a graphical user interface. It allows you to interact with the assistant through **text input** instead of voice commands.

**Features:**

* Text input for issuing commands
* Processing commands like opening applications, searching the web, and playing music (requires additional setup)
* Displaying output in the GUI

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.7 (or later)
2. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-usernameinfinotiver/aira.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python assistant_with_gui.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   `main.py` contains text based assistant
   
**Usage:**

1. Type your commands into the text input field.
2. Click the "OK" button or press Enter.
3. The assistant will process your command and display the output in the GUI.
4. **STILL WORK IN PROGRESS**

**Note:**

This project provides a basic framework. Adding functionality like music playback requires additional setup and configuration
