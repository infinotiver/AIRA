This Python project implements a personal assistant using the `customtkinter` library for a graphical user interface. It allows you to interact with the assistant through **text input** instead of voice commands.

**Features:**

* Text input for issuing commands
* Processing commands like opening applications, searching the web, and playing music (requires additional setup)
* Displaying output in the GUI

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.7 (or later)
2. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-usernameinfinotiver/aira.git
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python assistant_with_gui.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   `main.py` contains text based assistant
   
**Usage:**

1. Type your commands into the text input field.
2. Click the "OK" button or press Enter.
3. The assistant will process your command and display the output in the GUI.
